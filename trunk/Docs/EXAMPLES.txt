Melo AAC Decoder SDK 
  --- Examples ---
---------------------

1. Example Application

An example application, MeloDecode, is included. It shows how to parse an
MP4 file with AAC audio frames, use an MLO_Decoder object to decode the 
AAC audio frames into PCM samples, and save them to a WAVE file.
NOTE: this example application requires the Bento4 MP4 File Format parsing
library that can be downloaded at http://bento4.sourceforge.net .
In order to build this example application, the project files expect the 
Bento4 directory to be located at the same level (in the same directory) as
the Melo directory.
