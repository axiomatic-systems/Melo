Melo AAC Decoder
----------------

Melo is a cross-platform runtime library for decoding AAC audio. It is written 
in very portable ansi C and should compile on most platforms with a C compiler.

Documentation about how to build the library, the API, and license information
can be found in the Docs sub-directory.

You can find out more about the license in LICENSE.txt, about how to 
build the SDK and sample code in BUILD.txt, and about the example
applications and sample code in EXAMPLES.txt
You can also read some of the API documentation produced from the source
code comments using Doxygen. The Doxygen output is available as a 
windows CHM file in Melo.chm, and a set of HTML pages zipped together
in Melo-HTML.zip (to start, open the file named index.html with an 
HTML browser)

Please contact Gilles Boccon-Gibod (bok@bok.net) if you have any questions 
about this software distribution.
